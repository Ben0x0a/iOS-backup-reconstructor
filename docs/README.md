## Design principles

The tool is built for forensic use, which drives three rules that show up
throughout the code:

1. **The source is read-only evidence.** The backup directory is opened
   read-only and never written to. Output always goes somewhere else, and the
   tool refuses an output path inside the source backup.
2. **Fail closed.** If any row fails, no output is produced and a failure
   report is written instead. Partial output requires an explicit
   `--continue-on-error`.
3. **Everything is attributable.** Each run records the tool and version,
   source manifest hashes, per-file source and output SHA-256 digests, and the
   command line (with passwords redacted).
