"""Decrypt an encrypted iOS backup, keeping the backup's own layout.

Defines: `decrypt_backup` and the helpers that rewrite a backup's metadata so the
result is a structurally valid UNENCRYPTED backup.
Used by: core.reconstructor (the `--mode decrypt` path), gui.interface.
Depends on: core.reconstructor (shared manifest, traceability and staging
machinery), core.models, config.settings.

WHY this is a separate operation from reconstruction: rebuilding renames every
file into a device-like tree, which is a derived view. Decryption produces the
SAME backup with its content in the clear, so any tool that reads iOS backups —
and cannot read encrypted ones — can then read it. The two differ in what they
output, not in how they read the source.

── What gets rewritten, and why it must be ──────────────────────────────────────
An encrypted backup records each file's `Digest` as the SHA-1 of the CIPHERTEXT as
stored; an unencrypted backup records the SHA-1 of the CONTENT. Decrypting the
blobs without touching the manifest would therefore leave every digest mismatched,
and the output would read as corrupt to any tool that verifies it.

So three things are rewritten, and all three are recorded in the traceability
output rather than changed silently:

1. `Manifest.plist` — `IsEncrypted` becomes false and the key material
   (`BackupKeyBag`, `ManifestKey`) is removed. Leaving a keybag in an output that
   claims to be unencrypted is both confusing and needless key exposure.
2. Each `Files.file` metadata blob — `EncryptionKey` is removed and `Digest` is
   replaced with the SHA-1 of the plaintext.
3. `Manifest.db` itself — decrypted, then updated in place with those blobs.

Everything else is preserved byte-for-byte: the metadata blob is re-encoded from
the same decoded object graph, so fields this tool does not interpret survive
untouched.
